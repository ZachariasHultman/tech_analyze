# tech_analyze

Simply python script that uses the VERY INSECURE, NOT OFFICIAL, API FROM A SWEDISH BANK THAT NO ONE SHOULD USE to do technical analysis on whats in my watchlist.

A couple of things needs to be setup before using this program, all of them are related to this INSERCURE UNOFFICIAL API, so follow that information. Read the code and you will be able to guess what to search for to find this API.

# Secret Sauce
I have purposely leftout the metrics.py function, which contains all the juicy secrets on what i consider is a good stock or not.

# Disclouser
I'm not in any way associated with this swedish bank and I'm not educated in economics. So its all basically a guess and a collection of what other smart peolpe think on the internet.
