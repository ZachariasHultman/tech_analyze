# Technical analysis

A simple Python script that uses a VERY INSECURE, UNOFFICIAL API FROM A SWEDISH BANK THAT NO ONE SHOULD USE to perform technical analysis on stocks in my watchlist.

# Setup

Before using this program, you’ll need to configure a few things related to this UNSECURE, UNOFFICIAL API. I won’t spell it out, but if you read the code, you’ll get an idea of what to search for to find it.

# Secret Sauce

The metrics.py file is missing on purpose—it’s where all the magic happens. It contains my secret formula for what makes a stock “good” (or at least what I think makes it good).

# Disclaimer

I have no affiliation with this Swedish bank, nor do I have any formal education in economics. This script is just an experiment, loosely based on things I’ve read from smarter people on the internet. Use at your own risk.
